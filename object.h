/*
 * Definition of an object.
 * If the object is inherited, then it must not be destructed !
 *
 * The reset is used as follows:
 * 0: There is an error in the reset() in this object. Never call it again.
 * 1: Normal state.
 * 2 or higher: This is an interactive player, that has not given any commands
 *		for a number of reset periods.
 *
 * In the beginning, 'prog' points to the program tree, and 'status' to the
 * linked list of variable definitions.
 * After the object has been loaded back from the swap, the program tree
 * and variable deinitions will be stored in one sequential memory area.
 * This area will then be pointed to by 'block'.
 * If it is the case, free_prog() must not be called
 * with ob->prog as address, but rather free() should be called (once) with
 * ob->block.
