The file IDEA explains what the game is about and how to compile it.

* Use the command script 'config.mud' to configure.
  It has a few possibilities, but
  the only thing that works for the moment it 'config.mud inet'.

* Edit the file config.h and makefile for your environment.

* You should probably replace '-g' in makefile with '-O', as this will make
  the file smaller and faster. The '-g' is used for debugging.

* Then you only have to do 'make parse'.

* Edit the file mudlib/room/tune.h, to set the game at a good level.

* Edit mudlib/room/log.h, to define what things are supposed to be logged.

* Edit mudllib/WELCOME, which is the message printed when players connect
  to the game, before they have logged in.

* Edit mudlib/room/init_file. Some lines has been added here in LPmud 2.4.

'parse' is the game. Start it first. Use either telnet or 'frontend'
to communicate with 'parse'. The frontend program is under development,
especially with better output managing.

The file NEW specifies new features of this release. Copy it to
mudlib/CHANGES or something if you want to make it available to your wizards.
