The programming language should be better documented.

A tftp protocol could maybe be implemented, allowing wizards to send and
receive their files.

The 'struct lnode' should be remade into a union, containing all variations
of lnodes. This would remove a lot of casts, and clean up the program.

The string space should be allocated dynamically. stralloc.c does this, but
isn't used yet.

There is too much inflation in the game.

Some of the error resports that goes to the debug file should also
go to the wizards log file.

malloc.c: resort_free_list() should be called in a more clever way. Not
just from the church now and then. It would be better to call it when
it is needed, whatever that is. Using smalloc.c solved this problem.

Search pattern /*/ in ed will hang.

All calls to xalloc() should be replaced with direct call to the local

All predefined name indentification should be implemented with a hash table,
and thus removed from both lang.y and lexical.l. This would save space
and tidy up. Flex is fast, so maybe speed will not be saved.

If query_weight() in an object calls destruct(this_object()), then an
infinit loop will occur, that will crash the game.
