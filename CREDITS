The program was written originally by

Lars Pensj|, April 1990 (lars@cd.chalmers.se).


Other credits:

The regexp package was made by Henry Spencer.

The ed package was not done by me. See the file ed.c for information.

The soul was written by Tommy Finsen.

The generic weapon object and monster object was written by
    Jan Herder and Carl Halle'n.

Bit manipulations was implemented by pell@lysator.liu.se who also found
several bugs that had eluded me for months.

Valuable help and hints from: Mark Nagel, James Seidman, Moonchilde and more.

Geoff Skellams made all rooms in /room/south.

Mike McGaughey told me how important it was to collect the program for objects
in a sequential area. This reduced the working set for the game by 50 %.
He also implemented typeahead for players, guaranteed response time
and hashed object names.

Roland Dunkerley III fixed for-loops, do-while and the operators ++ and --.

Sean T Barrett made smalloc.c.
